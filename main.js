Practice: Building Arrays - 2: Practice: Creating Arrays 2

Instructions
You will complete two mini-challenges, each focusing on a different approach—one
with .fill() and one with a for loop. In doing so, you’ll practice how to turn
uninitialized slots into defined arrays.
Tasks
Task 1: Initialize the Array
1. Create an array with a size of seven.
2. Fill all slots with the string "Hello"using .fill
3. Log your array and confirm it has seven elements, all set to"Hello".
Task 2: Update the Array
1. Now, fill only part of the array with a different string or number using
.fill. For example, you might fill it with “Hi” or 2 or 5. You will need to
decide how many slots in the array to change.
2. Log your new changes.
Task 3: Populate the Array with a for Loop
1. Create a new array with a size of five.
2. Using a for Loop, assign each slot a numeric value that is index * 10
3. Log your results to confirm the array contains the correct values: 0, 10, 20,
30, 40
